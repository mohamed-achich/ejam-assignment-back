## Working With a Teammate

Our collaboration process would be:

1. **Initial Planning Meeting**
   - Break down tasks together
   - Estimate difficulty of each task
   - Divide work based on expertise and estimates

2. **Independent Development**
   - Each developer owns their assigned tasks
   - Write code and corresponding tests
   - Document any API changes or dependencies

3. **Pair Programming Sessions**
   - Review each other's code together
   - Catch potential issues early

4. **Integration**
   - Push to main branch with automated tests
   - CI/CD pipeline verifies code quality
